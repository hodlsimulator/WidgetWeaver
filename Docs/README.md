# Product docs

These documents are the product and release planning reference for WidgetWeaver.

- `PRODUCT_PRINCIPLES.md` — rules that keep the app “super complex but super simple”.
- `ROADMAP_Q1_2026.md` — roadmap and scope for the next release cycle.
- `RELEASE_PLAN_2026-02.md` — feature freeze → polish → ship checklist.
- `CHAT_HANDOFF.txt` — copy/paste summary for starting new chats without losing context.
