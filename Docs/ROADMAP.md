# WidgetWeaver roadmap

This repository ships WidgetWeaver: a WidgetKit-first editor that builds real widgets using a context-aware tool suite.

Primary roadmap documents:

- `docs/ROADMAP_Q1_2026.md` — what we are building, why, and when.
- `docs/RELEASE_PLAN_2026-02.md` — feature freeze → polish → ship checklist.
- `docs/PRODUCT_PRINCIPLES.md` — product rules that keep the app “super complex but super simple”.
- `docs/CHAT_HANDOFF.txt` — copy/paste summary for starting new chats without losing context.
