WidgetWeaver – chat handoff (copy/paste)
Last updated: 2026-01-20

Product
- WidgetWeaver is an iOS 26+ app that builds and previews real WidgetKit widgets via an Explore (template catalogue) + context-aware editor workflow.
- Widgets must be deterministic and budget-safe; heavy work (Vision, ranking, photo prep) happens in the app; widgets render from App Group state.

Strategic intent
- “Super complex, super simple”: powerful capabilities under the hood, but progressive disclosure in the UI.

Near-term schedule
- Today: 2026-01-20.
- Feature freeze: 2026-01-31 (stop adding features).
- Polish: 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-14.
- Target ship: ~2026-02-14 to 2026-02-16.

Current roadmap priorities (pre-freeze)
1) Photos: make Smart Photos + poster/photo widgets feel flagship (fast, reliable, good defaults).
2) Clock: Home Screen correctness and predictable customisation updates.
3) Noise Machine: promote it; keep responsiveness rock-solid; add 1–2 scoped upgrades only.
4) Variables: make them more accessible/discoverable, especially during text editing; surface built-in keys.
5) Reduce surface area: remove “Reading” from Explore/catalogue surfaces, but do not break existing user widgets.

Defer
- Weather: later (post-ship) unless it is already rock-solid; can be hidden/experimental.
- AI: post-ship R&D track; small, reviewable assistive steps; must generate explicit specs/config, not opaque state.

Key repo pointers
- Smart Photos pipeline: WidgetWeaver/SmartPhotoPipeline/*
- Crop editor: WidgetWeaver/SmartPhotoCropEditorView.swift
- Poster background/overlay: Shared/WidgetWeaverSpecView+Background.swift, Shared/WidgetWeaverSpecView.swift
- Home Screen clock widget: WidgetWeaverWidget/WidgetWeaverHomeScreenClockWidget.swift

Non-negotiables

- Do not introduce WidgetCenter reload loops from widget providers.
- Do not break existing user widgets when removing templates from Explore.
